This repository leverages Nx, a powerful monorepo tool, to manage a collection of projects centered around creating Sudoku applications using different frontend technologies. It promotes code reusability, efficient development, and a shared foundation for consistency across applications.

## üîë Key Features

 - **Modular:** The core package encapsulates styling, state management, types and event handling logic, enabling framework-agnostic reuse and reducing duplicate code.

 - **Flexible:** Experiment with different frameworks (React, Solid, Vue, Svelte) for the Sudoku app to evaluate their strengths and suitability.

 - **Organized:** Nx's structure keeps things clear and maintainable, separating applications and sharing code effectively.

 - **Efficient:** Leverage built-in Nx commands for streamlined development tasks like building, testing, and linting across all projects.

## ü¶∫ Functional Foundations

While this monorepo lets you explore Sudoku through popular frameworks, its true magic lies in embracing a functional approach, particularly within the shared core package.

 - **Immutability:** The core package adheres to functional principles, favoring immutable data structures and pure functions with well-defined inputs and outputs. This leads to code that's easier to reason about, debug, and trust.

 - **fp-ts Power:** The project uses the powerful fp-ts library to bring functional programming concepts to life. Expect to see structures like Option, Monoid, and Lens managing data flow and error handling gracefully, promoting code clarity and modularity.

## üéÄ Tailwind Styling

 This project uses Tailwind CSS for clean and consistent styling across different frameworks. A well-structured object in `packages/core/style/index.ts` defines styles for various components like the menu and board. It supports dynamic styling based on cell states and light/dark themes, ensuring a visually appealing and adaptable Sudoku experience.

## üéâ P5 Confetti Magic

This Nx monorepo adds a touch of celebratory flair with an integrated P5 sketch function for drawing dynamic confetti explosions! Nestled within `packages/confetti`, this reusable function seamlessly integrates into any framework-specific application, using framework-specific mechanisms (e.g., custom components, hooks).

## üõ†Ô∏è Start Development Server

To start a Sudoku app development server for a particular framework use:

```
npx nx run <project>:dev
```
Example:
```
npx nx run svelte:dev
```
